<p>Welcome to Cafe Daydream. We've just released Waterlilies, a beautifully designed timed puzzle game for iPhone and iPad.

<p>We're currently in review but will be releasing ASAP. Check us out on the App Store! (link coming soon)</p>

<p>Check back here this time next year for more games.</p>

<a id="what-are-the-orange-lily-pads-for" class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-orange-lily-pads-for" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are the orange lily pads for?</h2>

<p>The orange lily pads must be traced through twice in order to make them disappear. The more there are, the more difficult a level is, as it's tough to visualize paths through them.</p>

<p>You should email <a href="mailto:barista@cafedaydream.com">barista@cafedaydream.com</a> with the subject "Waterlilies Suggestion" and we'll let you know if we can incorporate your feedback. Alternatively, feel free to write us a review, we'll definitely read it.</p>

<p>The circle is a timer which indicates how much time you have left to complete the level. The amount of time you have depends on the number of lily pads in the level.</p>

How do you know there's always a solution?</h2>

<p>The levels are randomly generated such that there is always a solution. Later levels are made more difficult by increasing the lily pad density, the frequency of orange lily pads, and decreasing the time allowed.</p>
