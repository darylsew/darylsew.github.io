{"name":"Cafe Daydream","tagline":"","body":"#Welcome\r\nWelcome to Cafe Daydream. We've just released Waterlilies, a beautifully designed timed puzzle game for iPhone and iPad.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Waterlilies gameplay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darylsew/darylsew.github.io/master/ss.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe're currently in review but will be releasing ASAP. Check us out on the App Store! (link coming soon)\r\n\r\nCheck back here this time next year for more games.\r\n\r\n#FAQ\r\nIf you've come here for support because you're confused about how to play, we hope you'll find your question among the following. If you don't, shoot us an email at barista@cafedaydream.com with the subject \"Waterlilies Support\" describing the issue and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\n##What are the orange lily pads for?\r\nThe orange lily pads must be traced through twice in order to make them disappear. The more there are, the more difficult a level is, as it's tough to visualize paths through them.\r\n\r\n##I have feedback or a feature suggestion. What should I do?\r\nYou should email barista@cafedaydream.com with the subject \"Waterlilies Suggestion\" and we'll let you know if we can incorporate your feedback. Alternatively, feel free to write us a review, we'll definitely read it.\r\n\r\n##What's the circle in the upper right for?\r\nThe circle is a timer which indicates how much time you have left to complete the level. The amount of time you have depends on the number of lily pads in the level.\r\n\r\n##How did you make the levels? How do you know there's always a solution?\r\nThe levels are randomly generated such that there is always a solution. Later levels are made more difficult by increasing the lily pad density, the frequency of orange lily pads, and decreasing the time allowed.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
